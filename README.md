## This is my first ever serious project ever created, but I made it just for entertainment and did not take into account code organization or effectiveness at that time, therefore please expect this project to be all around messy but still works!

## How to Play

### On macOS
- Double-click `Play_Pokemon_on_Mac.command`

### On Windows
- Double-click `Play_Pokemon_on_Windows.bat`

## Notes
- Both launchers automatically run the game from the `GameFiles/` folder.
- Make sure Python 3 is installed.
- If dependencies are missing, run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## About the Launchers
The `.bat` (Windows) and `.command` (Mac) launchers are simple text scripts.  
- They **only run the main Python file** (`GameFiles/scripts/main.py`).  
- You can open them in Notepad/TextEdit to verify before running.

## Troubleshooting


If double-clicking the launcher does not work:

- On macOS:
  Option 1: Open a Terminal window, navigate into the project folder, and run:
  python3 GameFiles/scripts/main.py
  Option 2: Run the following command below on the terminal. First open the terminal by right clicking Pokemon-Final-Protocol and selecting New Terminal at Folder, this is to ensure the terminal has the project path set. Then try `Play_Pokemon_on_Mac.command` again.
  ```bash
  chmod +x Play_Pokemon_On_Mac.command
  ```
- On Windows:
  Option 1: Open cmd, navigate into the project folder, and run:
  python GameFiles\scripts\main.py
  Option 2: If you get a SmartScreen warning, click "More info" â†’ "Run anyway". If you see "Access Denied", Right-click `Play_Pokemon_on_Windows.bat` and choose "Run as Administrator".
